## Assessment Task

### Scenario
This is a data set which contains over 65K attempts to access a firewall. There is a single categorical feature "Action", that contains 4 categories - "allow, deny, drop, reset-both". Your task is to create a classification model that will predict the class of incoming traffic to the firewall.

### Requirements

You are required to use the dataset contained within the file "log2.csv" and then perform the following analysis by testing at least 2 classification algorithms:

- Perform an initial analysis of the data (EDA) using Python in your Jupyter notebook. Discuss your findings and what relevance they might have on your planned classification algorithms. 

- Perform any preparation of the data, that you feel is necessary, using Python in your Jupyter notebook. Explain your rationale behind your data preparation and how it will assist you.

- Create and Implement at least 2 classification algorithms that will output a classification based on the Action:(class attribute) feature. Test these models and try to improve it as you see fit. Discuss your findings and final rationale for choosing a particular classification algorithm.

- Make a classification using your test data, using your final classification algorithm, and comment on the accuracy differential between the training and testing set.
